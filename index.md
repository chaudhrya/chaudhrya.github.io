I am a PhD student in the Department of [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/).

My advisors are [Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/) and [Liza (Elizaveta) Rebrova](https://erebrova.github.io/).

Before Princeton, I did my undergrad at Brown University.

## Research Interests

I am interested in problems in optimization and the mathematics of data science.
