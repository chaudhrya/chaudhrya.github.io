I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).
I am currently working with [Katya Scheinberg](https://sites.gatech.edu/katya-scheinberg/).

I did my PhD in the Department of [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/).
My advisors were [Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/) and [Liza (Elizaveta) Rebrova](https://erebrova.github.io/).
You can read my thesis [here](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01vt150n65n).

Before Princeton, I did my undergrad at Brown University.
